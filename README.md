# Hello everyone, my name is Drew. This is me adding some information to my bio so that everyone knows who I am. I'm a nerd; I like strategy games of all kinds; card and board and video. I enjoy programming and building computers as well, and I'm also someone who loves the outdoors. Climbing and Hiking are where I spent most of my time outside of the apartment, specifically in the mountains if possible.
