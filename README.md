Yo! My name is Kennion! I am a software engineering major, and I love UI design and frontend development.

Hey guys, I'm Elijah Wilson! This is my Junio Year at BYU-Idaho and I'm studying Electrical Engineering. My wife and I got married in June, and life is good!.

Hello everyone, my name is Drew. This is me adding some information to my bio so that everyone knows who I am. I'm a nerd; I like strategy games of all kinds; card and board and video. I enjoy programming and building computers as well, and I'm also someone who loves the outdoors. Climbing and Hiking are where I spent most of my time outside of the apartment, specifically in the mountains if possible. 

Whassup!! I am Curtis Nash.  I am a Comp Sci major and I am currently hoping to work as a defense contractor with the Government.
I love to play sports and everything pop culture and nerdy (except Star Trek :P).
